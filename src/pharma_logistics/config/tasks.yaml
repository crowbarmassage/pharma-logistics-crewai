    Analyze the current delivery route operations for the following pharmaceutical
    products: {products}

    Your analysis must cover:
    1. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
       - Map existing delivery routes and their characteristics
       - Identify which products require cold chain handling
       - Document current priority classifications and delivery windows

    2. EFFICIENCY METRICS
       - Estimate route utilization rates
       - Identify redundant or overlapping delivery paths
       - Assess vehicle capacity utilization

    3. COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS
       - Cold chain maintenance risks on current routes
       - Time-sensitive delivery window compliance
       - Regulatory exposure points

    4. BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION
       - Geographic clustering inefficiencies
       - Peak demand timing conflicts
       - Priority tier conflicts (critical vs. routine)

    Provide specific, data-informed observations that can be acted upon.

    Based on the logistics analysis provided, develop a comprehensive
    optimization strategy for pharmaceutical delivery routes handling
    the following products: {products}

    Your strategy must address:
    1. ROUTE RESTRUCTURING RECOMMENDATIONS
       - Proposed route consolidations or splits
       - Geographic clustering optimizations
       - Hub-and-spoke vs. direct delivery trade-offs

    2. PRIORITY-BASED SCHEDULING
       - Critical medication prioritization protocols
       - Delivery window optimization
       - Buffer time allocations for high-priority items

    3. COLD CHAIN OPTIMIZATION
       - Temperature-controlled vehicle allocation
       - Route sequencing for temperature-sensitive products
       - Contingency protocols for cold chain breaks

    4. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
       - Phased rollout plan (Quick wins → Medium-term → Long-term)
       - Resource requirements
       - Success metrics and KPIs

    5. ROI PROJECTION
       - Estimated cost savings
       - Efficiency gains (time, fuel, vehicle utilization)
       - Risk mitigation value

    Be specific and actionable. Avoid generic recommendations.
